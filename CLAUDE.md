# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A preservation archive for Norsk Data minicomputer software. It stores compressed floppy disk images (`.img.gz`) with per-image YAML metadata, plus the TypeScript tooling (CLI, web UI, MCP server, static-site generator) that catalogs, imports, and serves them. It is a **data + tooling** repo, not an application — most "work" is either editing the TypeScript under `tools/src/` or curating the image/product/category metadata.

## Build & run

All tooling lives in `tools/` (Node.js, ESM, TypeScript compiled to `tools/dist/`). The Makefile is the entry point — every target depends on `setup`, which inits the git submodule, builds the bundled NDFS library, and compiles the tools.

```bash
make setup          # git submodule init + build externals/norskdata-ndfs + tsc tools
make import         # PRIMARY: web UI on http://localhost:3000 (import + map products + commit)
                    # 'make serve' is a backward-compat alias
make import-cli     # interactive console import wizard (import only)
make import-folder SRC=... CONTRIBUTOR=... SOURCE=... [RECURSIVE=1]   # scripted folder import
make import-file   FILE=... CONTRIBUTOR=... SOURCE=...                # scripted single-file import
make static-site    # build GitHub Pages site into site/
make site-serve     # build the static site + serve site/ on :8000
make mcp            # run the MCP server (stdio; launched by MCP clients, not watched in a terminal)
make check          # validate catalog integrity (run after metadata edits)
make identify PATH_=<file-or-folder> [ARGS="--recursive --only dos"]
                    # what does this image hold? works on any file, imported or not
                    # (PATH_ not PATH - PATH is reserved by make)
make search Q=...    # search the catalog
```

When iterating on TypeScript without the full Makefile flow, work directly in `tools/`:

```bash
cd tools && npm run build      # tsc + copies src/ui/index.html into dist/ui/
cd tools && npm run watch      # tsc --watch
cd tools && node dist/cli.js <subcommand>   # run any CLI command directly
```

There is **no test suite and no linter** — `make check` (the `check` CLI subcommand) is the validation gate. CI enforces it: `.github/workflows/validate.yml` builds the NDFS submodule, builds the tools, and runs `make check` on every push and PR to `main`. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` regenerates `site/` from source and deploys it; `.github/workflows/ia-verify.yml` checks Internet Archive checksums. CLI subcommands: `import`, `import-folder`, `search`, `check`, `check-deps`, `identify` (alias `detect`), `ia-sync`/`ia-verify`/`ia-upload`, `build-static-site`, `rebuild-catalog`, `migrate-products`, `extract-legacy`, `mcp`.

Two proof scripts under `tools/scripts/` are the closest thing to tests, and they assert the "one persist path" rule below:

```bash
node tools/scripts/roundtrip-proof.mjs        # every YAML field survives write -> reload
bash tools/scripts/persistence-proof.sh       # needs the dev server on :3000 (make import)
node tools/scripts/ndfs-recovery-proof.mjs    # what lib/ndfsrecover reads off the damaged floppies
```

`roundtrip-proof.mjs` sets a sentinel on every field of a real entry, writes YAML, reloads it, and asserts each sentinel came back — a field that does not come back is a read-without-write gap. `persistence-proof.sh` injects a field straight into `floppies.json` and proves a regenerate wipes it (JSON is a pure projection of YAML), then proves every mutation endpoint's change survives the same regenerate, and statically asserts no `saveCatalog()` call is reachable from live code.

## Architecture & data model

**YAML per floppy is the source of truth.** Every image lives in `images/{md5}/` where `{md5}` is the full MD5 of the raw `.img`. The folder holds `<name>.img.gz`, `<name>.yaml` (all metadata/classification), label photos (`*.JPG`), and optional `labels.txt`. Folders are content-addressed and **never renamed**, even when metadata changes. `catalog/floppies.json` and `catalog/products.json` are **generated** from the YAML files — never hand-edit them; run `rebuild-catalog` (or import, which auto-regenerates).

Products are separate YAML under `products/` (`id`, `name`, `categories`, `platform`, `docs`); categories are defined in `categories/product-categories.yaml`. A floppy's `product.id` links it to a product file.

**ND documentation.** `docs/nd/product-info/` and `docs/nd/installation-description/` hold ND's Product Information sheets and Program/Installation Descriptions as markdown, named by ND document number. A product's `docs:` block references them by id — one document often describes several products (`ND-10174-10-EN` covers ND-10174, ND-10575 and ND-10576), so documents are stored once and referenced, never copied per product. `api/nd-docs.ts` is the shared resolver used by both the static-site builder and the MCP server; `static-site-builder.ts` pre-renders each referenced document to `site/docs/<id>.html` at build time rather than inlining it, so `site/index.html` stays small and the no-`fetch()`/`file://` property holds.

**Not every image is an ND filesystem.** A real collection also holds MS-DOS floppies (ND-OWS / NORTEXT PC material), backup volumes, tar archives written straight to the media, blank disks and failed reads. Each floppy therefore records a `filesystem` field — `ndfs` | `dos` | `tar` | `backup` | `winch` | `none` — detected from the bytes by `api/filesystem-detect.ts`:

- **`dos`** — FAT12/16, recognised from the BIOS parameter block rather than the `0x55AA` signature (ND-era formatters often omit it). Read by the in-repo library `lib/dosfs/` (`DosVolume.open()` → `readDir`/`listAll`/`readFile`). A FAT label is also stored as `volumeLabel`, because on these disks it is an ND part number (`30002EN1A00`) and the Matcher matches on it exactly like an NDFS volume name.
- **`backup`** — SINTRAN III BACKUP-SYSTEM: an ANSI-labelled tape-style volume (`VOL1` at 0, `HDR1`/`HDR2` at the first or second sector boundary, `EOF1` closing each file). Labels name every file, so `lib/ndbackup/` lists and extracts them. BACKUP-SYSTEM does not erase the media first, so labels from an older run survive; they are flagged `stale` by comparing system code and date against the run that starts the volume.
- **`winch`** — WINCH-TO-FLOPP: a page-level dump of a whole ND directory across a set of floppies. **There are no file names on the media** — a 16 KB big-endian header maps each stored 2048-byte page to its page number in the original directory. One volume alone can only report "volume N of M", the directory name and the page map; file names need every volume of the set reassembled and then parsed as NDFS. Header layout verified against `flopp-to-winch.c`.
- **`tar`** — v7 tar, detected by header checksum (these have no `ustar` magic).

An image whose NDFS parse fails while ND `NAME:TYPE` file names are present in the raw bytes is recorded as `filesystem: ndfs` with a `condition: damaged` block (parser error, count and samples of the names found). It is an ND floppy that cannot be read, not blank media, and it stays in the Matcher's unreadable queue because there is no name to match on. The rule and what it implies are documented in `docs/media-condition.md`. The NDFS parser is always handed bytes padded up to a whole 2048-byte page (`lib/ndfsalign/`), because real reads are routinely a fraction of a page short and the parser refuses those outright.

Detection runs at import and is re-runnable afterwards: `POST /api/detect-filesystem?id=<entry>|?scope=missing|all`, a per-disk and a bulk button in the Matcher, and the `identify` CLI for files that were never imported. `api/identify.ts` is the shared summariser behind the CLI.

**NDFS parsing** is done by the bundled submodule at `externals/norskdata-ndfs/ndfs-ts` (imported as `norskdata-ndfs` via a `file:` dependency). It extracts volume name, boot format, users, file listings, and BPUN checksum validation. The same parser is bundled into the static site so the browser-based NDFS viewer runs client-side. If NDFS behavior looks wrong, the bug is likely in the submodule, not in `tools/src/`.

**Import pipeline** (`tools/src/api/import.ts`, `import-folder.ts`): read `.img` → MD5 → parse NDFS → validate BPUN → match volume name against ND product-number patterns (`product-matcher.ts` + `name-parser.ts`) — recorded as a *suggestion*; the floppy is left **unassigned** (productId null) so it is confirmed in the Matcher, never auto-linked → dedup by MD5 (`dedup.ts`) → gzip into `images/{md5}/` → copy photos (per-disk photos stay with the image; shared "set" photos consolidate into `collections/{product}/`) → write YAML → regenerate derived artifacts.

**One persist path.** After any import or product assignment, derived artifacts are regenerated from the YAML source of truth — never from an in-memory snapshot. `catalog.ts` `persistCatalog()` = `consolidateGroupPhotos` + `generateCatalogJson` (floppies.json + products.json). The web UI import/assign endpoints and the CLI (`import-runner.ts`) both then rebuild the `catalog/index.json` search index (`writeIndex`) and the static site (`buildStaticSite`), so every import path — web UI and `import-*` CLI — leaves the repo in an identical state. Do **not** persist the catalog by writing the in-memory catalog to JSON (`saveCatalog`) without regenerating from YAML; that can drift to a partial catalog.

**Two front-ends, two audiences.** The Express server (`server.ts`, `make import`, port 3000) is the *contributor workbench*: it renders every page live from the running Node process and is the only place that imports, assigns products, or commits. The static site (`static-site-builder.ts`, `make static-site`, output in `site/`) is the *public read-only window*: flat pre-rendered HTML, one file per product, served by GitHub Pages, which cannot run server-side code. `site/` is gitignored and rebuilt by CI from the YAML/catalog on every push, so any local `site/` is a throwaway preview — never edit it, and do not treat a large diff under `site/` as meaningful work.

### `tools/src/` map

- `cli.ts` — Commander entry point wiring all subcommands.
- `server.ts` — Express backend for the local web UI (`src/ui/index.html` is a single-page app served from `dist/ui/`).
- `interactive-import.ts` — prompted CLI import.
- `api/catalog.ts` — read/write YAML ↔ generated JSON; the catalog generation logic.
- `api/static-site-builder.ts` — the GitHub Pages generator (the only site builder; it writes the whole self-contained `site/index.html`).
- `api/product-matcher.ts` / `api/name-parser.ts` — ND volume-name → product/version/disk/language matching.
- `api/ia-sync.ts` — Internet Archive sync (large artifacts go to IA; floppies ≤1.3 MB stay in git).
- `mcp/server.ts` — read-only MCP server (stdio) exposing the catalog to LLMs; see below.
- `migrate*.ts`, `extract-legacy.ts`, `merge-legacy.ts` — one-off data migration scripts; not part of normal flow.
- `api/filesystem-detect.ts` — what a raw image holds; `api/identify.ts` — the summary the `identify` CLI prints.
- `lib/dosfs/` — FAT12/16 reader; `lib/ndbackup/` — BACKUP-SYSTEM and WINCH-TO-FLOPP readers; `lib/backupsets/` — groups the volumes of a backup set; `lib/ndfsalign/` — pads an image up to a whole NDFS page before parsing; `lib/ndfsrecover/` — reads a floppy whose master block is damaged. All are dependency-free and browser-safe, so they can be bundled for the static site the way the NDFS parser is.
- **Recovery** (`lib/ndfsrecover/`): the master block at offset 2016 of page 0 holds the pointers to the object, user and bit files, and if those 32 bytes are damaged the parser refuses the image even when the object file is intact. The pointers are not arbitrary — SINTRAN lays out a given geometry the same way (154/156-page floppies use object 150, user 152, bit 77; 616/640-page ones use 508/510/306) — so they can be reconstructed from floppies that read cleanly. A reconstruction is only accepted when the file names it produces are confirmed by the strings actually present in that image (default 80%); a wrong pointer lands on the wrong page and yields names found nowhere, which is what keeps recovery from becoming invention. The module writes nothing and never modifies an image; it takes the parser as an injected `probe` so it stays free of the NDFS dependency.
- `types.ts` — shared types; `zod` is used for schema validation.

**MCP server** (`mcp/server.ts`): a stdio MCP server, **read-only**, that loads `catalog/floppies.json` + `catalog/products.json` and exposes 10 tools (`search_floppies`, `get_floppy`, `list_product_floppies`, `list_products`, `download_floppy`, `list_floppy_files`, `get_archive_stats`, `list_product_documents`, `read_document`, `search_documents`). It reads `ARCHIVE_ROOT` (defaults to repo root). MCP clients launch it themselves via the repo's `.mcp.json`; `make mcp` is only for manually testing that it boots. It has no write tools — imports/edits stay in the web UI.

**Matcher queues** are decided by one function, `classifyForQueue()` in `server.ts`, used by both `/api/match/queue` and the dashboard counts — they previously carried separate copies of the rule and drifted apart. A parseable name wins first (`auto` when the product exists, `new` when it does not), then `broken` for an image with no filesystem, then `manual`. The name used is `volumeName ?? volumeLabel`, so a DOS disk matches on its FAT label.

## Conventions

- After editing image/product/category metadata, run `make check` and regenerate the catalog (`rebuild-catalog`) so `catalog/*.json` stays in sync with YAML.
- `make setup` must succeed before anything; if the NDFS submodule is missing, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- Storage policy: floppy images ≤1.3 MB are committed compressed; HDD images / tapes go to Internet Archive (`storageClass` + `internetArchive` fields in YAML drive this).
- The catalog view lists `filesystem: ndfs` only by default; `?filesystem=dos|backup|winch|tar|none|all` shows the rest. Images with no recorded filesystem count as ND so nothing disappears before a detect run.
- A running server caches the catalog but reloads when any YAML under `images/`, `products/`, `collections/` or `categories/` changes, so editing YAML by hand or switching branch is picked up without a restart.

## Git in this repo

- **Never `git add -A` / `git add .`** here. Imported floppy data routinely sits uncommitted in the working tree, so a blanket add sweeps unrelated images and YAML into someone else's commit. Always stage explicit paths.
- **Imported floppy data and metadata** (`images/`, `collections/`, `products/`, `categories/`, `catalog/`) go on a branch and through a PR, so the import can be reviewed before it lands.
- **Code and tooling changes** (`tools/`, `Makefile`, docs) push straight to `main`.
